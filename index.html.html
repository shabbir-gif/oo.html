            <p>Happiness</p>
            <p>In general, happiness is understood as the positive emotions we have in regards to the pleasurable
                activities we take part in through our daily lives.</p>

            <p>Pleasure, comfort, gratitude, hope, and inspiration are examples of positive emotions that increase our
                happiness and move us to flourish. In scientific literature, happiness is referred to as hedonia the
                presence of positive emotions and the absence of negative emotions.</p>

            <p>In a more broad understanding, human wellbeing is made up of both hedonic and Eudaimonic principles, the
                literature on which is vast and describes our personal meaning and purpose in life.</p>

            <p>Happy people live with purpose. They find joy in lasting relationships, working toward their goals, and
                living according to their values. The happy person is not enamored with material goods or luxury
                vacations. This person is fine with the simple pleasures of sitting under a tree, enjoying a cup of tea.
                Here are a few of the outward signs that someone is content.</p>

            <p>Is open to learning new things</p>
            <p>Is high in humility and patience</p>
            <p>Is often grateful</p>
            <p>Exercises self-care</p>
            <p>Enjoys healthy relationships</p>
            <p>Lives with meaning and purpose</p>
